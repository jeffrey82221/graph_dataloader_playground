# graph_dataloader_playground
Studying the usage of the data loader of Graph DL packages (DGL / PyTorch-geometric)

# TODO of DGL:

- [ ] Take in and study an official tutorial into DGL
- [ ] Extract the part of Dataloader 
- [ ] Show the result iterate from dataloader 
- [ ] Take in and study different versions of Dataloader 
- [ ] Try to implement a customized Dataloader (based on dataloader)
